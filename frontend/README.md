# Frontend

React application goes here.

You are free to:
- choose JS or TS (but TS is preferred ;-)
- mock APIs if needed

## CARE ABOUT
- UX/UI: clear, meaningful, self-explanatory and user-friendly interface 

## IGNORE
- ignore complicated stuff (but be ready to discuss how to handle them): performance, state management, security, accessibility
